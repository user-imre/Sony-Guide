'Uncompressed' is unnecessarily large, and 'Compressed' (lossy) should only be used if card space is extremely limited." },

For the absolute best editing performance on your computer, use 'XAVC S-I 4K' (creates very large files). 'XAVC HS 4K' offers the best compression (smallest files) but requires a powerful computer to edit smoothly." },

This captures over a billion colors, preventing banding and allowing for significant adjustments in post-production. Common frame rates are 24p for a cinematic look and 60p for smooth slow motion." },
